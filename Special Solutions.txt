The critical z-values for 7TYPE confidence with a two-tailed test are z = ± Z0Z0. \nNow we need to compare the absolute value of our z-value and the critical one. \nOur z-value of |z| = Z0ZZ is not more than z = Z0Z0, and therefore falls in the region of acceptance, which means we’ll fail to reject the null hypothesis and fail to conclude that the proportion is different than 1TYPE.
The critical z-value for 7TYPE confidence with an upper-tailed test is z = Z0Z0. \nOur z-value of z = ZZZ falls to the left of z = Z0Z0, and therefore falls in the region of acceptance, which means we’ll fail to reject the null hypothesis and fail to conclude that the proportion is more than 1TYPE. 
The critical z-value for 7TYPE confidence with a lower-tailed test is z = − Z0Z0. \nOur z-value of z = - ZZZ falls to the right of z = - Z0Z0, and therefore falls in the region of acceptance, which means we’ll fail to reject the null hypothesis and fail to conclude that the proportion is less than 1TYPE. 
The critical z-values for 7TYPE confidence with a two-tailed test are z = ± Z0Z0. \nNow we need to compare the absolute value of our z-value and the critical one. \nOur z-value of |z| ≈ Z0ZZ falls to the right of z = Z0Z0, and therefore falls in the region of rejection, which means we’ll reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the proportion is not equal to 1TYPE. \nWe know our findings are significant with confidence 7TYPE, but we can find the p -value to state a higher level of significance that corresponds to z ≈ Z0ZZ and not just z = Z0Z0. \nThe test statistic z ≈ Z0ZZ gives a value of NEWCONF in the z-table. \nWhich means the conclusion isn’t only significant at 7TYPE, but it’s actually significant at NEWCONF. \nAs long as confidence level ≤ NEWCONF, we’ll be able to reject H₀.
