The standard error will be σ(x̄) = σ/n \nσ(x̄) = 4TYPE/0TYPE \nσ(x̄) ≈ SIGMA. \nWe want to know the probability that the sample mean x̄ is within 6TYPE of the population mean. \nP(− 6TYPE/SIGMA < z(x̄) < 6TYPE/SIGMA) ≈ P(−ZZZ < z(x̄) < ZZZ) \nIn the z-table, a z-value of ZZZ gives PH and a z-value of −ZZZ gives PL. Which means the probability under the normal curve between these z-scores is \nP(−ZZZ < z(x̄) < ZZZ) = PH − PL \nP(−ZZZ < z(x̄) < ZZZ) = DP \nSo there’s an approximately DP chance that the mean x̄ will fall within 6TYPE of the population mean of μ.
Because population standard deviation is unknown, we have to use the t-distribution instead of the z-distribution. \nA 7TYPE confidence level with n − 1 = 0TYPE − 1 = DF degrees of freedom is associated with t-scores of t = ± TTT. \n(a, b) = x¯ ± t* s/√n \n(a, b) = 3TYPE ± TTT * 5TYPE/√0TYPE \n(a, b) ≈ 3TYPE ± MEE \nTherefore, we can say that the confidence interval is \n(a, b) ≈ (3TYPE − MEE,3TYPE + MEE) \n(a, b) ≈ (LB,HB) \nWe could also express this as the sample mean plus or minus the margin of error, 3TYPE ± MEE. \nWe’re 7TYPE certain that the actual population mean is between LB and HB.
Solve the margin of error formula for n. \nME = z* σ/√n \nME√n = z*σ \n√n = z*σ ME \nn = ( z*σ ME)² \nNow we can plug the values we were given into this equation, remembering that a confidence level of 7TYPE is associated with critical values of z = ± ZZZ. \nn = (ZZZ * 4TYPE * 6TYPE)² \nn ≈ AMOUNT (we round up to stay conservative)\nThen we can say that, to meet that threshold, and keep a margin of error of ±6TYPE at 7TYPE confidence, we’d need to take a sample size of at least n = AMOUNT.
First, build the hypothesis statements. \nH₀: p SIGN 1TYPE \nHₐ: The proportion is WORD than 1TYPE, p DIFFERENT 1TYPE \nThe sample proportion is p̂ = 2TYPE \nThen the standard error of the proportion is σ(p̂)= √(p0(1 − p0)/n) = √(1TYPE(1 − 1TYPE)/0TYPE) ≈ SE \nNow we have enough to find the z-test statistic. \nz = (p̂−p)/σ(p̂) = (2TYPE − 1TYPE)/SE ≈ ZZZ\n
We’ll find the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion.\nμ(p̂)= p = 1TYPE \nσ(p̂)= √(p(1 − p)/n) = √(1TYPE (1 −  1TYPE)/0TYPE) ≈ SIGMA \nWe need to find the probability that our results are within 6TYPE of the population proportion p = 1TYPE.\nz = 6TYPE/SIGMA ≈ ZZZ.\nWe want to know the probability of P(−ZZZ < z < ZZZ). Using a z-table, -ZZZ gives us PL, and ZZZ gives us PH.\nSo the probability we want to find is\nP(−ZZZ < z < ZZZ) = PH − PL \nP(−ZZZ < z < ZZZ) = DP \nThere’s a DP chance that our sample proportion will fall within 6TYPE of the claimed one.
We know that the sample proportion is p̂ = 2TYPE, and that the confidence level is 7TYPE. \nThe critical value for this confidence level is z* = ZZZ. The sample size is n = 0TYPE. \nSo we can plug these values into the confidence interval formula. \n(a, b) = p̂± z* p̂(1 − p̂)/n \n(a, b) = 2TYPE ± ZZZ * 2TYPE(1 − 2TYPE)/0TYPE \n(a, b) ≈ 2TYPE ± MEE \n(a, b) ≈ (2TYPE  − MEE, 2TYPE + MEE) \n(a, b) ≈ (LB, HB) This means that we’re 7TYPE confident that the proportion is between LB and HB.
The given proportion is p̂ = 2TYPE. The confidence level is 7TYPE and the test statistic for this confidence level is z* = ZZZ. The margin of error is ME = 6TYPE. \nPlug these values into the formula for margin of error from the confidence interval for a population proportion. \nME = z* √(p̂(1 − p̂)/n) \n6TYPE = ZZZ * √(2TYPE(1 − 2TYPE)/n) \n6TYPE = ZZZ * √(PP/n) \nSolve for n. \n6TYPE = ZZZ * √(PP/n) \n6TYPE√n = ZZZ * √PP \n√n = ZZZ√PP /6TYPE \n n = PP (ZZZ/6TYPE)² \n n = AMOUNT \nTo stay conervative, we have to round up to AMOUNT students, so we can say n = AMOUNT.
